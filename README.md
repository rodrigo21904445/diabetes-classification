## Diabetes Classification using Machine Learning Algorithms

I have used 2 datasets, one with 70,692 instances and another with 253,680 instances, and used several machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree Classifier (DTC), AdaBoost Classifier (ABC), XGBoost Classifier (XGBC), MultiLayer Perceptron Classifier (MLPC), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Logistic
Regression (LR) and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) to compare with each other and see which one its better to classify if an individual has diabetes or not.
